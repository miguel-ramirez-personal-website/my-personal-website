            <p>Puzzles are a fun medium I use to keep my brain active and distracted simultaniously. Being able to see the full picture ones i have completed them brings me great joy.</p>
            <p>3D puzzles and in particular Legos are my favorite because yopu get the chance to be a bit more creative in what final shape they take.</p>
            <p>They are also a pass time my fiance and I share. Puzzles are something we have done together since we first started dating.</p>

            <img src="https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/mountain-biking-lead-image-cnnu.jpg" alt = "MTB">
            <p>When I need to take a break form being indoors I enjoy Mountain Biking. Feeling the wind on my face with the trees rushing past me is very exhilarating.</p>
            <p>Not only is the speed and air I achive an adrenaline rush it is also great excersize.</p>
            <p>I have not had a chance to bike recently but hope to get out there soon.</p>

            <img src="https://repairsmith-prod-wordpress.s3.amazonaws.com/2022/09/car-repair.jpg" alt="mechanic"
            <p>I also enjoy working on cars. Wether its my own or helping family and friends out with theirs.</p>
            <p>My project car is a 1997 Toyota Celica which was handed down to me from my brother and hope to restore it back to as close to stock as possible. He made several modifications to it which are not really my style.</p>
            <p>Working on cars give me an even greater level of satifaction than puzzles. The whole process from diagnosing an issue to getting them up and running.</p>
